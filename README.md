# 3D-plane-game
This code is used to showcase a 3D plane animation game and gives us a design of different objects/ components of the plane and its surroundings which includes the trees, buildings, rings, etc. They have been given different colours and their relationship with respect to certain functions like rotation, viewport changes is shown. This can be useful in practical applications as it helps engineer sustainable structures. Here we have created a 3D model that can be reduced down to a 2D model in less cost. This model can be moved, rotated(along one or two axes), colored and manipulates the state which affects traffic passing through.
